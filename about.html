        <h2>About John</h2>
        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>
          John McClane was born on March 19, 1955 in Plainfield, New Jersey. His
          father was an Irish-American cop that made service in New Jersey and
          his mother was a house cleaner. In his youth, John attended a catholic
          school. His parents died as he was growing up. At some point in his
          adulthood he moved to New York City. Once he graduated from college in
          1979, he attended the New York City Police Academy and after one year
          of training he started as a beat cop with the rank of private for the
          first 5 years of his career. Excelling as an officer, he was swiftly
          promoted to detective in 1985. As he was serving as a detective, his
          captain promoted McClane into the rank of a police lieutanant.

          Eve, 1988, John travels to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his
          children. He first visits his wife Holly at the Nakatomi Plaza where
          she works, although she is initially pleased to see him they soon have
          a argument about Holly not using her marital name. Simultaneously, a
          gang of twelve terrorists led by Hans Gruber break into the Nakatomi
          Plaza and take all the employees, including Holly hostage. The gang's
          intentions are to steal the $640 million dollars in negotiable bearer
          bonds that are locked in the building's vault. McClane fights his way
          through the building, outnumbered thirteen to one and contacts the
          police on a stolen radio. When the police send Sergeant Al Powell to
          investigate, McClane gets his attention by throwing the body of Marco,
          a terrorist he killed, onto his car. McClane fights to save the
          hostages and defeat the terrorists who are revealed to really be
          thieves after $640 million in the building's vault.
