        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
          John McClane was originally based on the fictional character Detective
          Joe Leland from Roderick Thorp's bestselling 1979 novel
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Lasts_Forever_(Thorp_novel)"
            target="”_blank”"
          >
            Nothing Lasts Forever </a
          >. Other aspects are derived from Frank Malone from Walter Wager's
          1987 novel 58 Minutes (adapted as Die Hard 2).
        </p>
        <p>
          McClane's marriage is in a constant state of crisis, his vigilantism
          and disregard for authority have put him in danger of losing his job
          more than once, and he is a chain-smoker who is described by Inspector
          Cobb in Die Hard with a Vengeance as being "two steps away from
          becoming a full blown alcoholic", on which McClane jokingly corrects
          him saying only "one step".

            <li>
              McClane himself has killed 73 terrorists total throughout the five
              films.
            </li>
            <li>
              The only movie in which McClane didn't kill the mastermind was in
              A Good Day to Die Hard.
            </li>
            <li>
              McClane is voiced in the Japanese dubbed versions of the movies by
              Satoshi Nozawa.
            </li>
            <li>
              John McClane's humor and personality are slightly similar to
              another action hero named Martin Riggs (played by Mel Gibson) in
              Lethal Weapon, though a major difference is that McClane is fairly
              level headed whearas Riggs's sanity is often called into question.
