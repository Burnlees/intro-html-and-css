# intro-html-and-css

I created a basic webpage utilising both grid and flex. I tried my best to keep my HTMl semantic and accessible. 

I used many different selectors and specificities to style my page. 

I used a CSS reset and created my own CSS Custom Properties in their own seperate file, and imported them in to my main stylesheet.
